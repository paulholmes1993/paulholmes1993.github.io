In America, starting in high school you are expected to know what you want to do career wise and the steps you need to accomplish to get there. All throughout grade school you take meaningless classes teaching you math formulas you will never use after your end-of-chapter test, lessons informing you of failing economies & society growth trends of foreign  countries, plus the countless hours of 'busy work' assigned by slothful "teachers". Then, upon recieving an unstylish cap & wearing a gown with all of your classmates, you are expected to spend thousands and thousands of dollars to gain the real education needed to acquire a job to make a decent living. 

But, while you are making this decision of what to study, what is the basis? Is it the little research you have done online about said field? Or is it the voice of a parent/ close friend telling you what they think is best? Hardly any of the work presented to us in grade school helps to lend a hand in this decision. We are supposed to use our best judgement and then that 'educated' guess is what you do 5 days a week for the rest of your life in many cases. 

50-75% of college undergrads change their major at some point, resulting in wasted time and money we do not have to begin with. I believe this number could be reduced drastically if high school presented us with real life career options instead of pointless classes. If I would have had computer science courses teaching me the basics of programming or learning the ins & outs of the stock market & investing since 9th grade, just imagine the knowledge I would have upon graduating high school. I could actually know what i enjoy before commiting mass amounts of money & time into a dead end. I would be much more educated of topics going into further education, which in turn reduces time spent learning basics and more time to finely tune my skills.

I went through college and recieved a degree in marketing, and I do thoroughly enjoy all aspects of it. I have always been a people-person and knew it was an extremely universal degree. I love creating and building a brand or image, which is what led me to programming over the past few months. I had been speaking with a friend over time who is in the programming field and I finally had a little time, so I decided I would look into it and it has turned out to be a lifechanging decision. I love the problem solving aspect of coding as well as creating unique content and programs, but if i never had that conversation with my friend, I would not be here. But, if I would have been introduced to it in grade school, I could be 5 years ahead of where I am now. I don't regret or feel like Ive wasted these past few years, but I think our schooling could be improved. Educate our youth instead of wasting their time.
